        <h1>Events and Festivals</h1>

        <p>Buffalo's calendar of annual festivals, parades and events is huge and growing. Ethnic pride festivals such
            as the Buffalo Greek Fest, the Buffalo Italian Heritage Festival, and Dyngus Day play a preeminent role,
            though a diversity of events of all kinds is enjoyed by citizens. Naturally, the lion's share of these
            festivals take place during the warm months, but efforts have been made recently to expand the slate of
            offerings in winter as well.</p>


        <div class="season season-spring">
            <h2>Spring Events</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.buffalostpatricksdayparade.com/index.html"><strong> Buffalo St. Patrick's Day
                        Parade</strong></a>: Since 1940, on the closest Sunday to March 17th, downtown Buffalo has been
                the scene of New York State's second-largest St. Patrick's Day celebration, held by the Buffalo United
                Irish-American Association. Traditionally, Mass is said by the Bishop of Buffalo at St. Joseph's
                Cathedral on Franklin Street immediately before the participants gather at Niagara Square, marching up
                Delaware Avenue as far as North Street. The grandeur of this event is testimony to the continuing
                importance of Buffalo's Irish-American community. In addition to the downtown event, for 19 years
                running the Valley Community Association has sponsored the Old Neighborhood St. Patrick's Day Parade,
                which traces the route of Buffalo's first St. Patrick's Day parades along South Park Avenue through the
                old South Buffalo Irish neighborhoods of the First Ward and The Valley. </p>

            <p><a href="http://dyngusdaybuffalo.com/"><strong> Dyngus Day</strong></a>: Dyngus Day is a traditional
                Polish holiday that falls on the Monday after Easter; on this day, young boys are known to "slap" girls
                who catch their eye with pussywillows or squirt them with water guns in a courtship ritual called
                "śmigus". Today, Buffalo hosts the largest organized Dyngus Day celebration in the world—including
                Poland, where the festival has largely been forgotten. Since the mid-2000s, Buffalo's annual Dyngus Day
                celebration has once again been held in the traditional Polish neighborhood of Broadway-Fillmore at the
                grand old New York Central Terminal, a majestic old Art Deco train station that is yet another of
                Buffalo's architectural masterpieces that is undergoing extensive restoration. After the Dyngus Day
                Parade through the streets of Broadway-Fillmore opens the festivities, traditional Polish food and (even
                more popularly) drink are served in the old dining room, with polka bands attracting revelers to the
                dance floor. Celebrations are also held at St. Stanislaus, Bishop & Martyr Church (the so-called "Mother
                Church of Polonia"), the Adam Mickiewicz Library, and the many Polish-owned bars and taverns that
                continue to soldier on in the old neighborhood. </p>

            <h2>Summer Events</h2>

            <p><a href="http://www.allentownartfestival.com/"><strong>Allentown Art Festival</strong></a>: Every June,
                the Allentown Art Festival brings throngs of artists, craftspeople, food vendors, and visitors to the
                streets of one of Buffalo's most charming and historic neighborhoods. What was conceived in 1958 as a
                small art fair which would raise community pride in a then-dilapidated area, the Allentown Art Festival
                has grown into arguably the best-known of Buffalo's street festivals, with over 450 artists and
                craftspeople each year from all over the U.S., Canada and even Europe displaying and selling their wares
                to tens of thousands of visitors. High-quality paintings, sculptures, jewelry, crafts, and other works
                are available for purchase each year, often at excellent prices. Cash awards are given to artists in
                about a dozen different categories, as well as to the winner of the perennially popular competition to
                design the festival's annual poster. All proceeds from the festival are invested back into community
                improvement projects by the Allentown Association. </p>

            <p><a href="http://www.juneteenthofbuffalo.com/"><strong> Juneteenth Festival</strong></a>: Springing from a
                commemoration of the abolition of slavery in the state of Texas on June 19, 1865, Juneteenth is
                celebrated in the black community of the U.S. today as a holiday that signifies African-American pride
                and cultural heritage. Today, each June 19th sees Martin Luther King, Jr. Park on Buffalo's East Side
                host the nation's third-largest Juneteenth festival. Beginning with a parade that proceeds westward down
                Genesee Street from Moselle Street to the park, Buffalo's Juneteenth festival is a lively two-day
                celebration that includes demonstrations of traditional African and African-American art, music and
                dance, ethnic foods, crafts and wares, and activities for children. </p>

            <p><a href="http://buffaloplace.com/thursday"><strong> Thursday at the Harbor</strong></a>: Since 1986,
                Buffalo Place has hosted this long-running series of free summer outdoor concerts downtown, every
                Thursday evening from early June through early August. Originally known as "Thursday at the Square" and
                held at Lafayette Square in the heart of downtown, in 2011 event organizers responded to the
                increasingly large crowd sizes by moving the second half of the schedule to the much larger Canalside
                area. Beginning in 2012, the entire series will be held at Canalside, with the name change made official
                that year. Evolving from its humble beginnings as mainly a showcase for local bands, Thursday at the
                Harbor has grown to host internationally known artists and groups such as Blues Traveler,
                Parliament/Funkadelic, the Violent Femmes, Hootie and the Blowfish, They Might Be Giants, Big Bad Voodoo
                Daddy, and dozens more, and is also well-known for regularly showcasing Canadian acts such as Sam
                Roberts, the Lowest of the Low, Sloan, and 54-40. In addition to the free concerts, Buffalo Place also
                presents several top-tier acts a year at Canalside as part of Buffalo Place Rocks the Harbor, with
                admission charges of $10 for advance purchases and $20 on the day of the show. </p>

            <p><a href="http://shakespeareindelawarepark.org/"><strong> Shakespeare in Delaware Park</strong></a>:
                Delaware Park's Shakespeare Hill has since 1976 been the setting of Shakespeare in Delaware Park. With a
                goal of enriching, inspiring and entertaining diverse audiences through performance and educational
                programming with a focus on the works of William Shakespeare, this not-for-profit professional theatre
                company performs two selected Shakespeare plays annually from June until August at their striking
                Tudor-style outdoor stage adjacent to Hoyt Lake, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, and the Delaware Park
                Rose Garden. Performances are free of charge at this longstanding summertime tradition, though donations
                are greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p><a href="http://nationalgardenfestival.com/"><strong> Gardens Buffalo Niagara</strong></a>: With the goal
                of making Buffalo Niagara one of the premier destinations in the U.S. for garden tourism, Gardens
                Buffalo Niagara promotes Garden Walk Buffalo, the largest free garden tour in the United States, as well
                as many other garden walks throughout the various neighborhoods of Buffalo and surrounding communities
                where participating residents design and maintain beautiful gardens for visitors to enjoy. In addition,
                there are bus tours of the area's various urban farms, nurseries, and community gardens, the annual
                Garden Art Sale and Open Gardens on Thursdays and Fridays during the month of July.</p>

            <p> <a href="http://www.friendshipfestival.com/"><strong> Friendship Festival</strong></a>: Shared between
                Buffalo and neighboring Fort Erie, Ontario, the Friendship Festival is a weeklong celebration of almost
                200 years of friendship and mutual cooperation between the United States and Canada, and coincides with
                both Independence Day in the United States (July 4th) and Canada Day (July 1st). Beginning in late June,
                festivities are held on both sides of the Niagara River, notably Riverside Park in Buffalo and Mather
                Arch Park in Fort Erie. On both sides of the border, parades, classic car shows, War of 1812
                reenactments (at Old Fort Erie), live music, and fireworks are enjoyed. </p>

            <p><a href="http://www.buffaloitalianfestival.com/"><strong>Sorrento Cheese Buffalo Italian Heritage
                        Festival</strong></a>: The second-largest Italian-American heritage festival in the United
                States as well as one of the five largest street festivals of any description in the country, the
                Buffalo Italian Heritage Festival was held for ten years on Connecticut Street before it followed most
                of the city's Italian population, moving in 1988 from the Lower West Side to North Buffalo. Today,
                600,000 visitors crowd the vicinity of Hertel and Delaware Avenues for four days each July to enjoy live
                music, carnival rides, and revelry of all kinds. The star of the show, of course, is the food, with
                offerings from such well-known Italian markets as Guercio & Sons and Mineo & Sapio Meats as well as
                demonstrations by chefs from Italian restaurants in the area such as Marotto's, Marco's and the North
                End Trattoria. </p>

            <p><a href="http://infringebuffalo.org/"><strong> Buffalo Infringement Festival</strong></a>: This new
                festival, which takes place annually on the last week of July and the first week of August, is a
                celebration of genre-defying, boundary-pushing DIY art and spectacle by artists who may not have the
                straight-world cachet or blockbuster budgets that those who display at the Allentown or Elmwood Avenue
                festivals have. Displays of music, dance, theater, and visual arts, as well as more offbeat genres such
                as puppetry, fire art, mime, and "miscellaneous insurrection", can be seen at a multiplicity of venues
                around the city free or for a nominal price. </p>

            <p><a href="http://www.buffalowing.com/"><strong>National Buffalo Wing Festival</strong></a>: Each Labor Day
                weekend sees Coca-Cola Field in downtown Buffalo host the National Buffalo Wing Festival, two days
                dedicated to Buffalo's best-known addition to the annals of American cuisine. Inspired by the 2001 movie
                "Osmosis Jones" as well as a column by iconic Buffalo News editorialist Donn Esmonde, the National
                Buffalo Wing Festival has, since its inception, drawn nearly 600,000 hungry guests from all 50 states
                and 33 foreign countries to Buffalo, who have collectively eaten over 3 million chicken wings and raised
                over $200,000 for various local charities. Showcased by a long list of national media such as "The Today
                Show", "The View", "Live with Regis and Kelly", numerous Food Network series, and even a PBS
                documentary, the National Buffalo Wing Festival sees over 30 restaurants in Buffalo and around the
                country—including the Anchor Bar, where chicken wings were first served in 1964—serve up their
                individual recipes and compete for prizes. </p>

                Thanksgiving Day weekend, with the Buffalo Convention Center transformed into New York State's largest
                dance floor. Every year, thousands of locals and visitors age 21 and over dance the night away to the
                retro tunes that are played on the festival's 500,000-watt soundsystem, and have the chance to meet
                disco-era celebrities that have included Henry Winkler, Erik Estrada, Leif Garrett, and the cast of "The
                Brady Bunch". The World's Largest Disco has been featured on the front page of the Wall Street Journal
                as well as such television programs as "CBS This Morning", VH-1's "Where Are They Now", and the Travel
                Channel's "Secrets". All proceeds go to benefit Camp Good Days and Special Times, a local summer camp
                for children with cancer. </p>

                        Lighting</strong></a>: In addition to serving as the official opening of the ice skating season
                at the Rotary Rink at Fountain Plaza, the lighting of downtown Buffalo's Christmas tree has unofficially
                kicked off the holiday season in the local area since 1984. Immediately after the tree lighting, the
                crowd can enjoy an exciting fireworks display over Fountain Plaza, followed by horse and wagon rides,
                clowns and balloon art, face-painting, free ice-skating (skate rental $3, $2 for children) and, of

                the United States. Beginning in Boston in 1976, First Night made its way to Buffalo in 1989. In addition
                to the "ball drop" that takes place at the stroke of midnight from the top of the Niagara Mohawk

                season for which Buffalo is well-known, but also has as a primary mission the preservation of,
                appreciation for, and investment in Buffalo's system of Olmsted parks. The 2012 Flurrious! festival
                included a foot race around Delaware Park's Ring Road, bike ride, snow golfing, snow tennis, igloo
